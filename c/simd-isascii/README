You can generate test data via the following command, and then just
use ‘echo foo >>out’ to write some non-ASCII into the stream.

	$ tr -cd ' -~' </dev/urandom | head -c BYTES >out

Findings:
1.  GCC Doesn’t auto-vectorize the generic loop
2.  The AVX-2 version out-performs AVX-512 by a huge margin
